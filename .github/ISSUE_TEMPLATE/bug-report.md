**Pre-flight checklist**

- [ ] I am only describing a single issue.  (If you want to report multiple, please file them individually so they can be referenced and closed separately.)
- [ ] I have upgraded to the latest version of CWX and its dependencies; the issue still persists.
- [ ] I have verified that the issue is specific to CWX, and have ruled out other plugins that work indirectly with CWX (e.g. attributes).

**Environment**

- Operating system: <!-- Windows / Linux; provide version / distribution -->
- SourceMod version: <!-- in major.minor.rev.patch form -->
- CWX version: <!-- the value of the `cwx_version` ConVar -->
